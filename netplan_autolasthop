So this is the Ubuntu netplan config for "autolasthop" requirement.
By autolasthop, I mean the situation where a host has multiple network interface and you need the host to send reply for packet destined to it based on where it came from.
This leverage routing policy on linux.
On this snipped, here is the sample situation:
- Linux host has two NICs: ens32 and ens33
- ens32 is assigned IP address of 10.52.34.104/27 and ens33 is assigned IP address of 10.52.34.74/29
- whenever there is request coming to 10.52.34.104, it is required for host to send reply back via ens32, and
- whenever there is request coming to 10.52.34.74, it is required for host to send reply back via ens33
- this requirement need to not impact to default route that the host need to have (via ens33 in this case)

## Netplan config line starts below
network:
  ethernets:
    ens32:
      addresses:
      - 10.52.34.104/27
      routing-policy:
      - from: 10.52.34.104
        table: 32
      routes:
      - to: 0.0.0.0/0
        via: 10.52.34.126
        table: 32
